# PuddlesLanguage!  
  
I, for some still unknown reason to me, decided to write my own coding language over the end of lockdown and this is what came out of it. It's still being worked on

### Variables  
> Currently there is only a 'var' variable for all types of variables. Others are being added  
  
#### int
An integer variable. If the user attempts to assign a <code>float</code> to an <code>int</code> variable, it will return an error, but assign the rounded <code>float</code> to the <code>int</code> variable
