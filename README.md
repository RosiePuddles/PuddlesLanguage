# About

Over lockdown, I decided to try make my own coding language after not liking C. I apolagise to anyone who likes C. But this is the mess of a language I came up with in the end.

## Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

I started with no knowledge of any of this, and I learned it all from [Code Pulse](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUVahoidFA7F3Asfvamrm7w) and their tutorial on [creating a coding language in Python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD). Also as everyone does, I did some very one sided collaboration with [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).
